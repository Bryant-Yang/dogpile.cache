    dogpile.cache 1.0.0 was released with a minimum Python version of 3.5.
    However, due to a dependency issue, the minimum version is now Python 3.6.
    The 1.0.0 release will be removed from PyPI so that Python versions prior
    to 3.6 will continue to make use of the previous dogpile.cache 0.9.2.
