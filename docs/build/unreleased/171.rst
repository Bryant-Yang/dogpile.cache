    Added option to the Redis backend
    :paramref:`.RedisBackend.thread_local_lock`, which when set to False will
    disable the use of a threading local  by the ``redis`` module in its
    distributed lock service, which is known to interfere with the lock's
    behavior when used in an "async" use case, within dogpile this would be
    when using the :paramref:`.CacheRegion.async_creation_runner` feature. The
    default is conservatively being left at True, but it's likely this should
    be set to False in all cases, so a warning is emitted if this flag is not
    set to False in conjunction with the distributed lock. Added an optional
    argument to :class:`.RedisBackend` that specifies whether or not a
    thread-local Redis lock should be used.  This is the default, but it breaks
    asynchronous runner compatibility.
